# Copycat Twitter Bot
A twitter bot written in Python and using the tweepy API that- based on another account's tweets- generates its own random posts at random times and replies to every mention towards it.

## Preparations & Prerequisites
* Owning a Twitter account (_duh_).
* Applying for a [Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com) (it takes some form filling and half a day, give or take).
* Creating an App through the Twitter Developer Account with tweeting/replying permissions on
* Generating the 4 useful keys (`API key`, `API secret key`, `Access Key`, `Access Secret Key`) to be used in the python script for authentication.
* Having Python 3.5.2 or higher on your system (as far as I tested it out).
* Installing tweepy as its docs show [here](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/install.html).

## Execution Guide
